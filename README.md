# PROJECT: UX TOOLING
## BY: NISHANT MALIK and JOBANJIT SINGH
### Link to Final Project https://github.com/nishantmalik20/Project-UX/
NISHANT and JOBANJIT, we both worked upon the project, equally carrying out all the operations. We both worked upon the project, first we build a website of our favorite automobile manufacturer using HTML and CSS and then we put enough content so that the page has enough content to scroll. Then we added some of the core UX changes.
 ### Things to test:
- Clean and minimilist design.
- The navigation bar is fixed at the top.
- When a user scrolls the page headings are fixed just below the navigation bar so that the user can have a clear idea of what the content is he scrolling through.
- A progress bar is added on top of the screen so that a user is aware of how much of the content is left and how much the user has scrolled.
- Responsiveness is added for three screen sizes, for iPhone, iPad, and desktop.
- On iPad and iPhone, the navigation bar is placed with a red hamburger on the top right corner of the screen.
### References:
- No external references are taken in HTML and CSS.
- A little reference from https://www.w3schools.com  is taken in JS part.
